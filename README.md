# CRU Profiles 🖥️

A collection of optimized **Custom Resolution Utility (CRU)** profiles for specific monitors. These profiles are designed to improve system responsiveness, remove "useless" ghost resolutions, and ensure your display is running at its absolute best.

## 🎯 Purpose
Windows often populates your display settings with dozens of redundant resolutions and TV-standard timings that can interfere with GPU scaling and system latency. These profiles provide a "debloated" configuration by:
- **Removing Redundant Resolutions:** Only keeping the ones you actually need.
- **Optimizing Timings:** Using "LCD Reduced" or exact native timings to reduce blanking intervals.
- **Forcing Correct Refresh Rates:** Ensuring your monitor stays at its maximum rated speed without Windows downclocking it.
- **Cleaning Metadata:** Removing unnecessary extension blocks that can cause issues with display drivers.
